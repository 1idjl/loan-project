```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-project.git
   cd ml-project
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Preprocess the data by running:
   ```
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. Train the model:
   ```
   python src/train.py
   ```

3. Explore the data using the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook notebooks/exploration.ipynb
   ```

## Testing

Run the unit tests to ensure the model behaves as expected:
```
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```
